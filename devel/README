This is the development environment for swig to generate the pbs_python files that are used in the pbs_python package.
There are two directories:
 * C    ---> Is for torque versions 2.4/2.5 and maybe 3.X (not tested)
 * C++  ---> Torque 4.X version switched to C++. This version is tested with 4.2-dev


If you want to assist in the development of the pbs_python package ask for write access:
